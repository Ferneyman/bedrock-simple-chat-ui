# Development Workflow

## Local Development
- Start development server: `npm run dev` (runs on http://localhost:5173)
- Use Vite's hot module replacement for fast development
- Test authentication flow locally before deploying

## Code Quality
- Run `npm run lint` before committing code
- Follow ESLint configuration in [eslint.config.js](mdc:eslint.config.js)
- Use React hooks properly (no violations of rules of hooks)
- Maintain consistent code formatting

## Build Process
- Build for production: `npm run build`
- Output goes to `dist/` folder
- Test build locally: `npm run preview`
- Ensure all environment-specific configurations are handled

## Deployment Options

### Manual Deployment
1. Build the application: `npm run build`
2. Package dist folder: `cd dist && zip -r ../deployment.zip ./*`
3. Upload to AWS Amplify Console manually

### Automated Deployment
1. Fork repository to your GitHub account
2. Connect AWS Amplify to GitHub repository
3. Use the provided build configuration in README.md
4. Enable automatic deployments on push to main branch

## Testing Strategy
- Test authentication flow with different Cognito configurations
- Test all three agent types (Bedrock, Strands, AgentCore)
- Test error handling and edge cases
- Test responsive design on different screen sizes
- Test speech-to-text functionality in supported browsers

## Configuration Management
- Never commit sensitive configuration to version control
- Use localStorage for client-side configuration persistence
- Validate all configuration before saving
- Provide clear error messages for invalid configurations

## Security Considerations
- Always use HTTPS in production
- Validate all user inputs
- Handle AWS credential expiration gracefully
- Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive information
- Follow AWS security best practices for IAM roles and policies
